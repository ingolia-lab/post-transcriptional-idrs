# post-transcriptional-idrs
Files, scripts, models, and images for 'Deciphering disordered regions controlling mRNA decay in high-throughput' (Lobel & Ingolia).
Scripts can be run directly if the repository is downloaded to the home directory. Model parameters are provided in appropriately labelled folders.
Raw sequencing data are available at Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number GSE254492)

Descriptions of data within each folder are present in a Fig-X_readme

Processed_scores contains scores calculated from Sort-seq counts (in raw_counts and GSE254492). 

HMM_analysis contains composition and motif dependent repressors calculated from the mutational scanning data. 

Sequence_tables_dna contains various supplementary tables of strains, plasmids, oligos, and libraries. Screening_lib_seqs contains similar information used within some of the scripts.

gateFlow.R contains script used for gate settings for flow cytometry analysis.
