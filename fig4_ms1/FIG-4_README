FIG-4: README
HMM profiles are generated with indiv_hmmPlotter.R in the FIG-3 folder. 

tis11_mut_flow contains flow files and scripts for calculating the YFP/RFP ratio of wildtype Tis11 repressor and a mutant (Fig. 4b). 

tis11_growthCurvePlotter.R plots the growth curves for tis11 phenotypes (Fig. 4c and Extended Data 5). 

eap1_flow_seriesV2 folder contains flow files and scripts for calculating the YFP/RFP ratio of Eap1 tethering constructs.
